Please save that email and send the exact email and attachments to all new drivers coming in. Also, please save driver availability form to your favorites, as you will be accessing that daily. Jordan and I would like you to send out weekly emails to drivers with any pertinent information or items that you would like to address. Since it is impossible to complete driver meetings with everyone this will be a great way to communicate with everyone. If you could please cc or bcc Jordan and I, it would be appreciated. &nbsp;I can send you a few examples of what Terri, our SF manager sends to give you a few ideas. I also send them out bcc so I&#8217;m not providing other drivers email address out to everyone. Honestly, the easiest thing to do would be to create a driver address book, that way you can just type in &#8220;mankato drivers&#8221; and it will populate all mankato driver email addresses in there, so you don&#8217;t have to type them out all the time.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I&#8217;m assuming it will be pretty quiet the next day or two. We will be making a FB post today letting everyone know that we are &#8220;live". I&#8217;m hesitant to do too much with the predicted blizzard. Not sure how bad the weather will be, but the snow could be a blessing to help get us orders. I will also be making a "now open" flyer and printing those off today. We can set that up, along with coupon cards at each location. I hope to have both of those for you tomorrow.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div><br></div><div><div id="MAC_OUTLOOK_SIGNATURE"><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><font face="Bodoni 72"><i><b>Megan Culver, Co-Owner</b></i></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><i>Food Dudes Delivery</i></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><i>952-290-6085 Direct</i></div><div><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">mculver@staging.fooddudesdelivery.com</i></div><div><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><br></i></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><i><br></i></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><i><br></i></div></div></div></body></html>
