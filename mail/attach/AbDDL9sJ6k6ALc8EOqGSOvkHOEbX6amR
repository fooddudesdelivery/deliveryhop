Superior delivery is the partnership you are issued k-1 for your income from
that.  You also are issued 1099 for the delivery income from superior
delivery or any other entity you delivered for in the food dudes network.
Twin ports would be your own llc and you would need to create this entity if
you have not done so before.  You will only receive a 1099 and k-1 form me
for you taxes and you will need to file schedule c for the twin ports
business.

Thanks,

Dave

Subject: accounting and tax questions

Hi Dave,

I have included Josh, who is working my taxes and potentially some
accounting for me.  He has a copy of our agreement, and possibly has some
additional questions, so he can properly get my taxes done, and clear
understanding moving forward.  Most of these questions will apply to 2017,
since I only have 1099 income in 2016.

I know his initial questions are regarding Superior Delivery and Twin Ports
Delivery and the layout of how things work. I originally thought that
Superior Delivery was the previous company and it was replaced with Twin
Ports Delivery, but I then I also recall you stating TPD was my LLC. 
With what we muddled through in the agreement, Superior Delivery is DBA Food
Dudes and each partner then has their own LLC as well?

With that, we were also looking for (I believe this is what he called it)
Articles of origination for Twin Ports Delivery, as he wasn't finding it
online. I thought from our previous communication, you were creating that
(as I was a little confused), and taking the fee out of what was to be paid
out to me.

I maybe should have taken more time to connect with you on this and really
understand everything from the beginning.   Anyways, can you clarify the
questions above and help Josh out with any additional questions he may have?

Thank you very much for your help!
