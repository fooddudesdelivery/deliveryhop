Good to hear from you.<br>
1) We are doing minimal marketing right now. Our team in St. Cloud should<br>
have some digital ads going, but we are holding off on heavy marketing<br>
until we have completed our recruiting process for a management position<br>
here in Mankato. It looks like when we are ready, this is something we<br>
could perhaps work together on?<br>
2) This varies significantly, and has many factors.  It will depend on<br>
things including restaurant involvement, popularity of your restaurant,<br>
and the clientele who are ordering.  We establish many large lunch<br>
customers who may order $100-400 for large groups.  Overall, our company<br>
average is $30 tickets with $1000 a week in overall sales. Looking through<br>
my restaurants in Duluth, the ones on the fast food/low ticket prices are<br>
at about $20-25 average tickets, with $500-1000 in weekly sales. In the<br>
winter months I see these climb significantly to $1000-1500.<br>
<br>
Will you be around today or tomorrow morning? It would be great to meet in<br>
person!<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
Josie<br>

&gt; Hi Megan,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks for the email and information. Here&#39;s a couple follow up questions.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1.) What are you currently doing for marketing in the Mankato area?<br>
&gt; 2.) What is the current average volume a &quot;fast food&quot; business with a lower<br>
&gt; ticket price is experiencing on a weekly basis?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt; ..<br>

&gt;&gt; Hi Wesley,<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; My name is Megan Culver, and I am the co-owner of Food Dudes Delivery in<br>
&gt;&gt; Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Food Dudes Delivery is Sioux Falls’<br>
&gt;&gt; premiere<br>
&gt;&gt; restaurant delivery service that currently partners with over 50 local<br>
&gt;&gt; restaurants, such as Applebee’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, Firehouse subs,<br>
&gt;&gt; etc.<br>
&gt;&gt; I’m reaching out to you, as my partner Josie; who is the managing<br>
&gt;&gt; owner of<br>
&gt;&gt; Food Dudes Delivery in Duluth, and I recently launched delivery services<br>
&gt;&gt; in<br>
&gt;&gt; Mankato. We’ve received feedback requesting delivery from your<br>
&gt;&gt; restaurant<br>
&gt;&gt; location, so we would greatly appreciate a few moments of your time to<br>
&gt;&gt; discuss our delivery process, partnership opportunities, and how we are<br>
&gt;&gt; here to enhance your business with incremental sales. Would you be free<br>
&gt;&gt; next Tuesday the 30th, or Wednesday the 31st to visit for 15-20 minutes?<br>
&gt;&gt; Please let me know what works best for you.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; **I’ve attached some basic information about our services. I apologize<br>
&gt;&gt; as<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; We will bring you roughly $1,000 per week or $52,000 per year in extra<br>
&gt;&gt; sales. Our average order is $30. At $1,000 per week we are typically<br>
&gt;&gt; bringing you about 5 or 6 orders per day. If your current kitchen staff<br>
&gt;&gt; can<br>
&gt;&gt; handle that, then you are gaining sales without increasing labor or<br>
&gt;&gt; overhead costs.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Thanks again for your time and consideration. We look forward to hearing<br>
&gt;&gt; back from you!<br>
